A simple little falling sand game I created to improve my skills with OOP.

Controls:
Left Click - Place/Destroy/select element
Right Click - Displays the position of the mouse
Space bar - Pause simulation
Numbers 0 to 9 - select area of effect 1 being the smallest and 0 being the biggest


Ideas for later additions/improvements:
- Text for element selection
- sand compresses to sandstone
- Pause indicator
- Optimisations 
- Give every object proper densities
